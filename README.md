## Bootc CentOS Workstation

An atomic workstation built on the CentOS Stream 10 `bootc` image.

### Currently building image:

### `bootc-centos:latest`

- Very minimal workstation installation with KDE Plasma
- Tailored for specific hardware and personal use; most firmware and many packages removed
- bootc-native workflow using `bootc-base-imagectl` for image rechunking
- Some pre-configured system-wide defaults
- Justfile and `jmain` alias for initial configuration and basic system maintenance
- Modular build files for easy image customization

### These images are intended only for my personal use
